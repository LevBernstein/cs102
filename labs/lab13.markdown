## Lab 13 Intro to Graphs 

Solve and submit one (or more) of the problems. Work with your group to figure out 
the solution before trying to code it. Come up with a few 
tests in addition to the sample tests shown in the problem. 

To get credit for _progress and participation_ category, take a 
screenshot of one of the submission reports (even if it is a failed attempt) and 
upload it to Gradescope under lab 13 __before the end of you recitation__. (Make sure you are submitting an image file
not a source code file to Gradescope.)

You can keep working on the actual problems after the recitation since these autograders are not 
on Gradescope. 



- [Ab Initio](https://open.kattis.com/problems/abinitio) - the description
is long, but it is a fairly easy problem if you have a graph implementation
already 

- [Alphabet Animals](https://open.kattis.com/problems/alphabetanimals) - decide if you 
really need to implement a graph; if not, how does this problem relate to a graph? 

- [Flying Safely](https://open.kattis.com/problems/flyingsafely)

- [Cantina of Babel](https://open.kattis.com/problems/cantinaofbabel) - this is not a difficult problem, but you need to first figure out 
how to map it to a graph.
