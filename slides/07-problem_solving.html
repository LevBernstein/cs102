## Bracket Matching

Mathematical expressions use parenthesis to modify the order of operations.
<br>For example, $3 \times ( 5 - 7 )$ is different than $(3 \times 5) -7$.

Before evaluating an mathematical expression, we want to be able to verify
that all the parenthesis in that expression are matched properly, since
otherwise we cannot evaluate such an expression.
<br>For example,
$(3 \times (5 - 7)$ and $4 \times (( 2 - 1()$ do not make sense.



#### Problem 1

Come up with an algorithm that validates parenthesis in mathematical expressions.
The algorithm should take a string that contains the expression as input,
and report either valid (true) or invalid (false).

#### Problem 2

In programming languages parenthesis are used along with other types of brackets.
Revise your algorithm so that it can validate expressions that contains `{`,`}`,
`[`, `]` and `(`, `)`.

## Mystery Algorithms

What do these algorithms do?

.left-column2[
__Mystery 1:__

.box[
input: a positive integer n

output: ???

algorithm:

```
create an empty stack
while n > 0 :
    stack.push(n % 2)
    n = n / 2

while stack is not empty
     print stack.pop()

```
]]
.right-column2[
__Mystery 2:__

.box[

input: a positive integer n

output: ???

algorithm:
```
create an empty queue

queue.enqueue(0)
queue.enqueue(1)
for  i  in 0 .. n
    a = queue.dequeue()
    b = queue.dequeue()
    queue.enqueue(b)
    queue.enqueue(a + b)
    print a
```
]]

.below-column2[
Test them out with a few values of `n` to try to figure it out.

## Josephus Problem

A simply counting out game that children play goes as follows:

.smaller[

- a number is picked, call it K
- a direction is picked: right or left
- a child that starts is picked

- all children are in a circle and as long as there are more than 1 children in the game
they keep playing
  - the first child counts 1
  - the next child (to the right or left based on the direction) counts 2
  - the next child counts 3
  - ...
  - the next child counts K and is removed from the game
  - the next child counts 1
  - ...
  - the next child counts K and is removed from the game
  - ...

- the one remaining child wins the game
]

(The real Josephus problem is much more gruesome.)

--

#### Problem
Write a program that simulates this game. Given a number of children, the value
of K and the direction, the program should determine the winner (or rather the
position of the child that will win, assuming that child at position 1 starts
the game).

## Integer list

The programming language _Better And Portable Code_ (BAPC) is a language for
working with lists of integers. The language has two built-in functions:
- `R` = reverse the input and return the result
- `D` = drop the first element and return the rest, or return `error` in case its input is
an empty list

.left-column2-large[
To get more advanced behavior, functions can be composed: `AB` is the function
that first applies `A` to its input and then `B` to the resulting list.
For example, `RDD` is a function that reverses a list and then drops the first
two elements.

Your task is to write an interpreter that processes instructions written in BAPC.
Given a BAPC program and its input, return its output or "error" in case `D` is
applied to an empty list.
Lists are represented as the character `[` followed by a comma-separated list of
integers followed by the character `]`. Notice that the input and output lists
can be quite long.
]

--

.right-column2-small[
__Example 1__

Program: `RDD`<br>
Input: [1,2,3,4]<br>
Output: [2,1]


__Example 2__

Program: `DD`<br>
Input: [102] <br>
Output: error


__Example 3__

Program: `RRD`<br>
Input: [1,1,2,3,5,8]<br>
Output: [1,2,3,5,8]

## Backspace

Shortly before the programming contest started, Bjarki decided to update his computer.
He didn't notice anything strange until he started coding in his favorite editor, Bim (Bjarki IMproved).
Usually when he’s writing in an editor and presses the backspace key a single
character is erased to the left. But after the update pressing that key outputs the character <.
He’s tested all the editors on his machine, but they all seem to have the same problem.

He doesn't have time to search the web for a solution, and instead decides to
temporarily circumvent the issue with a simple program.

.left-column2[
Help Bjarki write a program that takes as input the string that was written in the
text editor, and outputs the string as Bjarki intended to write it.
You can assume that Bjarki never intended to write the character <, and that Bjarki
never pressed the backspace key in an empty line.
]

.right-column2[
__Example 1__

Input: `a<bc<` <br>
Output: `b`

__Example 2__

Input: `foss<<rritun` <br>
Output: `forritun`

__Example 3__:

Input: `a<a<a<aa<<` <br>
Output:

## Synchronizing Lists

For this problem, you have two lists of numbers, each list having length `n`.
Each number in one list has a corresponding number in the other list.
The correspondence is that if both lists were in sorted order and placed side by side,
each pair of numbers would correspond.

For example, in the lists (48,10,97) and (7,46,20),
the corresponding numbers are 10 with 7, 48 with 20, and 97 with 46.
This is because if you sort the first and the second lists, their orders would be: <br>
`(10, 48, 97)`<br>
`( 7, 20, 46)`

You want to keep the lists synchronized (i.e., if the numbers get
swapped in one list, their corresponding numbers should be swapped as well).
You know that the second list has gotten out of order and you need to fix this.

For example, given the two lists above, the second list should be reordered as (20,7,46)
to be in order with the first list.

--

__Example__

Input:
```
list 1: (10, 67, 68, 28)
list 2: ( 6, 55, 73, 10)
```

Output:
```
( 6, 55, 73, 10)
```

## Room Painting

Joe’s landlord has allowed him to paint his room any colour that he wants, even
multiple colours. Joe has come up with a very colourful design. Now he needs to
buy the paint.

Being a struggling student, Joe does not want to waste any money,
so he has calculated the exact amount that he needs of each colour down to the
microlitre. To his surprise, however, the local paint shop is unwilling to sell
him a can of exactly 3.141592 litres of red paint.

The shop has a set of specific paint can sizes. The shop
has almost unlimited amount of paint of each color, so each can can be filled
with whatever colour Joe wishes and the shop has unlimited number of cans of each
size.

Joe has no choice but to buy a little bit more paint than he really needs.
Still, he would like to minimize the amount of paint wasted. In addition,
he does not want to buy more than one can of any given colour.

---

## Room Painting

__Input__

The first line of input contains two integers
- $1<=n<=100,000$ the number of paint can sizes offered by the paint shop, and
- $1<=m<=100000$, the number of colours that Joe needs.

Each of the next $n$
lines contains the size of a can offered by the paint shop, in microlitres. Each can contains no more than 1000 litres.

Each of the next $m$
lines contains the number of microlitres that Joe needs of a given colour.
It is guaranteed that for each colour, the paint shop sells a can large enough to satisfy Joe’s needs.

__Output__

Output a single line, the total number of microlitres of paint wasted if Joe buys,
for each colour, the smallest can that satisfies his needs.

## Evaluating Math Expressions

How would you write a program to evaluate a mathematical, arithmetic expression?
For example something like this

$$ ((15/(7-(1+1)))\times3)-(2+(1+1)) $$


The code that can evaluate such expressions has to:
- find and evaluate all subexpressions that are surrounded by parenthesis;
- for each operator figure out what its operands are; this involves determining
precedence of operators (i.e. knowing the order of operations)

--

It turns out that it is much simpler to write code for evaluation of arithmetic
expressions when they are written in a format that lets us ignore parenthesis
and that does not depend on operator precedence.
These two ways are __prefix__ and __postfix notations__.

--
- In __prefix__ notation the operator comes __before__ its operands.
- In __postfix__ notation the operator comes __after__ its operand.

--

|infix|prefix|postfix|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `2 + 5` | `+ 2 5` | `2 5 +` |
|`(2 + 4) &#215; 5` | `&#215; + 2 4 5` | `2 4 + 5 &#215;`  |
|`2 + 4 &#215; 5` | `+ 2 &#215; 4 5` | `2 4 5 &#215; +` |

## Prefix Notation (a.k.a. Polish Notation)

For more details and the history see the Wikipedia page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation.

--

#### Algorithm for evaluating prefix expressions

.box[
input: string containing a valid prefix expression

output: value of the expression

```
create an empty stack

scan the given prefix expression from right to left
for each token in the input expression
  if the token is an operand then
      push it onto a stack
  else if the token is an operator then
      operand1 = pop stack
      operand2 = pop stack
      compute operand1 operator operand2
      push result onto stack

return top of stack as result
```
]

--

__Problem__

Write your own program to evaluate prefix expressions.
