## Data Structures and Algorithms
### What are they?

--


A __data structure__ is a collection of data items in a memory of a running program that
are organized in some fashion that allows items to be stored and retrieved by some fixed methods.

An __algorithm__ is a logical sequence of discrete steps that describes a complete solution
to a given problem commutable in a finite amount of time and space.


--

.left-column2[
.smaller[
Examples of data structures from CSCI.UA 101:
- __array__: data items are organized and after another and they can be accessed by
their index number,
- __stack__: collection of items with access (add/remove operations) only at the _top_ of the stack (think of a stack of plates).
]]

.right-column2[
.smaller[
Data structures covered in CSCI.UA 102:
- __list__
- __stack__
- __queue__
- __tree__
- __binary tree__
- __hash table__

Other data structures:
- __many different types of trees__
- __many different types of graphs__
]]

# Why do data strutures matter?

.big[.heavy[
I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his
data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their
relationships.

## Demo 1:
### Create a string with lots of 'a's.

.left-column2[
```Java
String str = new String();

for(int i = 0; i < NUMBER; i++){
    str = str + 'a';
}
```
]
.right-column2[
```Java
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

for(int i = 0; i < NUMBER; i++){
    sb.append("a");
}
```
]

--

- When `NUMBER` is set to 400,000:
    - the code on the left takes __32518 milliseconds__ (i.e., over 32 seconds) to execute
    - the code on the right takes __~6 milliseconds__ (i.e., you do not even notice that any time passed)

--

- Why?
    - we'll need to look at _how_ the `String` and `StringBuilder` classes are implemented
    - we need to understand what data structures and algorithms each class uses


---
## Demo 2:
### Iterating over a list of numbers


.left-column2-large[
Program 1:
```Java
LinkedList<Integer> numbers = new LinkedList<>();
LinkedList<Integer> twiceNumbers = new LinkedList<>();
populateList(numbers, size);

for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    twiceNumbers.addLast(numbers.get(i) * 2 );
}
```
Program 2:
```Java
LinkedList<Integer> numbers = new LinkedList<>();
LinkedList<Integer> twiceNumbers = new LinkedList<>();
populateList(numbers, size);

for (int num : numbers ) {
    twiceNumbers.addLast( num * 2 );
}
```
]

--

.right-column2-small[

In this program we have a list of numbers. We want to iterate over the list, double each number
and add it to a new list.

What is the difference between these two loops?

When `size` is set to 100,000 program 1 takes __4,676 milliseconds__ to execute
and program 2 finishes in __~8 milliseconds__.


---
## Demo 3, part 1:
### Creating and searching in collections of `Circle` objects


.left-column2-large[
Program 1:
```Java
Collection<Circle> tree = new TreeSet<>();
//create lots of Circle objects and add them
//to the tree one at a time
createCircles( tree, size);
```
Program 2:
```Java
Collection<Circle> list = new LinkedList<>();
//create lots of Circle objects and add them
//to the list one at a time
createCircles( list, size);

```
.smaller[
Common to both:
```Java
public static void createCircles(Collection<Circle> col, int size) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        col.add(new Circle((int)(Math.random()*Integer.MAX_VALUE)) );
    }
}
```
]
]

--

.right-column2-small[

In this program we first create a tree and a list of `Circle` objects.

How does the _shape_ of the collection going to affect the running time?

--

When `size` is set to 1,000,000 program 1 takes __594 milliseconds__ to execute
and program 2 finishes in __70 milliseconds__.


---
## Demo 3, part 2:
### Creating and searching in collections of `Circle` objects


.left-column2-large[
Program 1:
```Java
Collection<Circle> tree = new TreeSet<>();
//create lots of Circle objects
createCircles( tree, size);

//search for a specific circle
Circle c = new Circle(102);
tree.contains(c);
```
Program 2:
```Java
Collection<Circle> list = new LinkedList<>();
//create lots of Circle objects
createCircles( list, size);

//search for a specific circle
Circle c = new Circle(102);
list.contains(c);
```

]

--

.right-column2-small[

Once the two collections of `Circle` objects are created, we want to find out
if a circle with radius 102 got created.

When `size` is set to 1,000,000 program 1 takes __0.02 milliseconds__ to search
and program 2 takes  __8 milliseconds__ to search.

---
## Demo 4:
### Calculating Fibonacci Numbers

.left-column2[
```Java
public static long fibonacci1 (
                  long number ) {
    //base case
    if (number == 0 )
        return 0;
    else if (number == 1 )
        return 1;
    //recursive case
    else
        return fibonacci1(number - 1)
             + fibonacci1(number - 2);
}
```
]

.right-column2[
```Java
public static long fibonacci2 (
                  long number ) {
    //base case
    if (number == 0 )
        return 0;
    else if (number == 1 )
        return 1;
    //iteratively compute the result
    else {
        long tmp1 = 0;
        long tmp2 = 1;
        long result = 0;
        int counter = 2;
        while ( counter <= number) {
            result = tmp1 + tmp2;
            tmp1 = tmp2;
            tmp2  = result;
            counter++;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
]

--

.smaller[
- When we try to compute the 40<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number:
    - the code on the left takes __463 milliseconds__
    - the code on the right takes __~0.008 milliseconds__

- BUT, the code on the left appears so much simpler

## Technical Interviews

And if Linus Torvalds and my demos did not convince you that understanding data
structures is important and exciting, there are always technical job interviews:

--

- most technical interview questions are based on data structures and algorithms

- examples:
    - design a min-stack that performs typical stack operations and is able to
    retrieve the smallest element at any time quickly
    - describe an algorithm that can parse through a mathematical expression and
    validate if all brackets and parenthesis are in a correct order and matched
    - find all anagrams of a given string that are also words in the given dictionary
    - determine if a given binary tree is a search tree
--

- why?
--

.left-column2[
    - because for a software developer / programmer / computer scientist data structures
    and algorithms are essential tools (just like a wrench is for a plumber)

### Group Discussion: Why do we care so much about programs being fast?


- In breakout rooms of 3-4 people discuss why you think it
is important for the programs to run fast.

- You should think about it from two different perspectives:
    - why do you want a program on your computer to work fast?
    - why is it beneficial to the society if the programs run fast?
(this one is a bit more challenging)

- After ~5 minutes, some groups will get a chance to report on what
they came up with.

## Tips for the Course

- __Understand the concepts and reasons for doing things__. Do not use a particular solution/approach just
becase a tutor or TA  (or even the instructor) said it was a good idea. Do not memorize things if you do not
know what they are doing. Question things! Be curious!

--

- __Use pen and paper__ (or the modern equivalents). Draw things out and experiment with the ideas. It often helps to
draw out variables and objects of a piece of code that you are analyzing and update the picture as you go through
the code. This type of hand-eye interaction stimulates different parts of your brain and helps you learn!

--

- __Try solving problems yourself__. I mean really work them out BEFORE asking for a solution,
looking at a solution posted by others or trying to search the web.

--

- __Write code solutions yourself__. Don't just read the code or watch the video showing the code.
Don't copy and paste, type it up yourself and then compare it to the code we
wrote in class or the code that is in the book.

--

- __Treat mistakes and bugs as your friends__. The more problems you encounter, the easier it is to
recognize them in the future. Your brain actually rewires itself when you make a mistake and fix
it - this is how learning happens.

--

- __Make friends__. Make sure that you meet at least a few other people in the class and get to
know them. These friendships will benefit you and other people in the class, and, in some case, may
last a lifetime.
