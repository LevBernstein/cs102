## Generating Sequences

## Generate All Sequences ...

In some situations we want to be able to produce all possible sequences of
some set of characters.

__Example__

Imagine you are implementing a program that is a _Scrabble Helper_. The
player has a particular set of letters and your program is supposed to come
up with all seven letter words that can be created from those letters.

An algorithm:
- create all possible sequences of the letters
- check each sequence in an approved dictionary (throw out the ones that are not there)

(This is a very slow algorithm, but ... )

--

-----

We'll start with slightly easier examples:
- generate all sequences of two characters: '0' and '1'
(or all binary sequences) of a particular length
- generate all sequences of ten characters: '0', '1', ..., '9'
(or all decimal sequences) of a particular length
- generate all binary sequences that do not end in a zero
- generate all binary sequences that do not have a 1 in a third position
- generate all binary sequences that have fewer than 5 ones
- generate ...


---

## Generate All Binary Sequence of Length `n`


If `n=3`, all binary sequences of length `3` are
`000`, `001`, `010`, `011`, `100`, `101`, `110`, `111`.

There are eight of them because we have three positions to fill
and two options for each position, so $2^3 = 8$.

- Decide what the base case could be (there may be different ones that will work)

- Decide what the recursive case could be.

- Put together an algorithm that accomplishes the task.

## Generate All Binary Sequence of Length `n`

__Idea__ generate each sequence starting from zero length and adding
either `0` or `1`. The recursive calls need to _grow_ the sequence until
we reach the desired length (base case).

--

__base case__
`len(sequence) == n`

--

__recursive case__
- add 0 to the current sequence: `sequence + '0'`
- add 1 to the current sequence: `sequence + '1'`

--

__algorithm__

_input_: `sequence=""` is the initial sequence, `n`  is the desired length

```
getAllBinarySequences ( n )
  getAllBinarySequences ( n, seq = "")

getAllBinarySequences ( n, seq )
  if len(seq) = n
    we have one of the sequences
    return
  seq0 = seq + '0'
  seq1 = seq + '1'
  generateAllBinarySequences( n, seq0)
  generateAllBinarySequences( n, seq1)
```

---

## Generate All Binary Sequence of Length `n`

Finally, we can convert the algorithm into Java code.
For simplicity, we print the sequence once it is ready. We could also
add it to a list of some kind for later usage.

```Java
void getAllBinarySequences ( int length ) {
  getAllBinarySequencse(length, "");
}

void getAllBinarySequences ( int length, String seq ) {
  if (seq.length() == length ) {//reached the desired length
    System.out.printf("%s %n", seq.toString() );
    return;
  }
  /add the next bits to the sequence (two possibilities)
  String seq0 = seq + "0"; //add zero to the current sequence
  String seq1 = seq + "1"; //replace the zero with one
  getAllBinarySequences( length, seq0);
  getAllBinarySequences( length, seq1);

}
```

A few questions:
- what will be the first string printed?
- what will be the last string printed?
- how would the answers to above questions change if the revered 
the last two lines of the above code?

exclude:false
name:no-0-in-second

## No `'0'` in the Second Position


A slight variation of this problem is to generate all sequences
except the ones that meet some condition. For example:
exclude sequences that have a zero in the second position (zero-based indexing).

--

We can generate all sequences as before and then skip the ones that
we do not want.

--

__algorithm__

_input_: `sequence=""` is the initial sequence, `n`  is the desired length

```
getAllBinarySequences ( n )
  getAllBinarySequences ( n, seq = "")

getAllBinarySequences ( n, seq )
  if len(seq) = n
*   if (seq[2] != '0' )
*     we have one of the sequences
    return
  seq0 = seq + '0'
  seq1 = seq + '1'
  generateAllBinarySequences( n, seq0)
  generateAllBinarySequences( n, seq1)
```



--

<br/>
.center80[
.red[
But this means that we are creating many more sequences than we need to (twice as many)!
<br/>It all takes time, especially for large `n`.
<br/>Can we avoid generating sequences that we do not want?
]
]

---
template: no-0-in-second

We want to stop the algorithm from adding the zero to the second position:

__better algorithm__

_input_:  `n`  is the desired length

```
getAllBinarySequences ( n )
  getAllBinarySequences ( n, seq = "")

getAllBinarySequences ( n, seq )
  if len(seq) = n
    we have one of the sequences
    return
* if len(seq) != 2
*   //do not add '0' if adding to the second position
*   seq0 = seq + '0'
*   generateAllBinarySequences( n, seq0)
  seq1 = seq + '1'
  generateAllBinarySequences( n, seq1)
```

This way we avoid making a lot of unnecessary recursive calls.

# Backtracking

---

## Backtracking

__Backtracking__ is an approach of solving problems in which we keep going as
long as we can, and if we run into a dead end, we just go back to a previous place
where we had a choice to make and pick an alternative way.

--

If this seems a bit too abstract, think of going through a maze:
- each time we come to a fork (with two or more options), we follow just one
- if that path goes to the exit, we got lucky,
- if it we get stuck, then we go back to the place  where we made the choice
and pick an alternative path

name:target_search

## Is there a subset that adds up to a target?

Given an array of non-negative integers and a target value, determine if there are any values within the array that add up to the target.

--

Example

```
[ 3, 8, 1, 0, 5]  target 4  ---> yes
```
--
```
[ 3, 8, 1, 0, 5]  target 14  ---> yes
```
--
```
[ 3, 8, 1, 0, 5]  target 7  ---> no
```
--
```
[ 3, 8, 1, 0, 5]  target 10  ---> no
```
--
```
[ 3, 8, 1, 0, 5]  target 20  ---> no
```


---
name: target_search_approach1
template: target_search


### __Approach 1__

- start with sum = 0
- gradually increase it until sum is equal to target (or not)

--


__base case__

- when sum = target, we have yes

--

- when sum > target, then the current path is a no (but there may be another path that gives us a yes)

--

__recursive steps__ (or how do we get to the base case)

- for each value in the array we have two options:
    - use it to count towards our target (add it to the current sum)
    - do not use it (do not change the current sum)
  (keep trying both option in recursive calls)



---

template: target_search_approach1

```

  find_target( array, target, index, sum )

    if sum == target   //found it!
      return true

    if sum > target   //too much, no point in continuing
      return false

    // recursive case
        // use the element at index
        // do not use the element at index

```


---

template: target_search_approach1

```

  find_target( array, target, index, sum )

    if sum == target   //found it!
      return true

    if sum > target   //too much, no point in continuing
      return false

    return find_target( array, target, index + 1, sum + array[index])  // use the element at index
            ||
           find_target( array, target, index + 1, sum )  // do not use the element at index



```

--
<br/>

- Is there a reason why above would not work?
  <br/>What happens if the array is [1, 1, 1, 1] and target = 10?

---

template: target_search_approach1

```

  find_target( array, target, index, sum )

    if sum == target   //found it!
      return true

    if sum > target   //too much, no point in continuing
      return false

    if index == array.size  //stop if the end of the array is reached
      return false

    return find_target( array, target, index + 1, sum + array[index])  // use the element at index
            ||
           find_target( array, target, index + 1, sum )  // do not use the element at index



```


---
name: target_search_approach2
template: target_search


### __Approach 2__

- start with sum = target
- gradually decrease it until sum is equal to zero (or below)

--


__base case__

- when sum = 0, we have yes

--

- when sum < 0, then the current path is a no (but there may be another path that gives us a yes)

--

__recursive steps__ (or how do we get to the base case)

- for each value in the array we have two options:
    - use it to count towards our target (subtract it from the current sum)
    - do not use it (do not change the current sum)
  (keep trying both option in recursive calls)

## Avoiding Repeated Calls

## Fibonacci Numbers - A Familiar Classic

$$fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)$$
$$fib(0) = 0$$
$$fib(1) = 1$$

--

Here is one way to compute Fibonacci Numbers using recursion:

```
int fib ( int N ) {
  if N <= 1
    return N
  return fib (N-1) + fib(N+2)
}
```
--

So what is wrong with that implementation? <br>

--

It computes the value of each Fibonacci number multiple times!

---
name:fib_memo

## Fibonacci Numbers without repeated calls

Let's use an array to _remember_ the values that were previously computed

--

```
  //initialize the array to all -1 (value impossible for Fib numbers)
  //to indicate that the value has not been calculated yet

  int memo[MAX_N];
  for i in 0 ... MAX_N:
    memo [i] = -1;

```

---
template:fib_memo


```
  //initialize the array to all -1 (value impossible for Fib numbers)
  //to indicate that the value has not been calculated yet

  int memo[MAX_N];
  for i in 0 ... MAX_N:
    memo [i] = -1;

  //use similar function to before, but check if the value was already
  //calculated before making recursive calls

  int fib ( int N ) {
    if memo[N] != -1
        return memo[N]    //retrieve it from memory
    if N <= 1
        return N
    memo[N] = fib (N-1) + fib(N+2)  //save it for future use
    return memo[N]
  }
```

---
## Fibonacci Numbers - start from the bottom

Calculate all Fibonacci numbers from 0 to N

```
int fib[MAX_N]

void fib_all ( int N ) {
  fib[0] = 0
  fib[1] = 1
  for i in 2 ... N:
    fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]
}
```
--

Calculate the N'th Fibonacci number


```
int fib ( int N ) {
  if N <= 1
      return N
  int prev1 = 0
  int prev2 = 1
  for i in 2 ... N:
    int next = prev1 + prev2
    prev2 = prev1
    prev1 = next
  return prev1
}
```

# Examples and Things to Think About

---

## All Decimal Sequences

Design an algorithm that generates all decimal sequences (using characters
'0', '1', ..., '9').

Follow the steps that we did for the binary sequences:
- decide on the base case
- decide on a recursive case
- design an algorithm (specifying what its initial inputs are)

---

## All Sequences For Scrabble

Design an algorithm for generating all sequences of characters given a set of characters
(a sequence can use a particular character multiple times or not at all). <br/>
HINT: this is just like a previous-slide problem, but uses characters instead of digits.

__Part 2__

Do the same as above, but do not reuse characters. This limits the number of sequences
that can be produced. <br>
For example, given letters 'c', 'a', 't', we can create "atc", "act", "cat", "cta", "tac", "tca".

__Part 3__

Do the same as above, but generate __only__ sequences that are words in a given dictionary.
Try to do this efficiently, so that you do not generate sequences that _do not lead_ to a word.

---
## Is there a subset that adds up to a target?

1. Design pseudocode for approach 2. Test it with a few examples by hand to make sure it works.

2. Implement both approaches.

3. Create some _good_ tests for your program. For each test, write a sentence describing what it is actually testing.

4. How would approach 1 and 2 have to change if we would allow negative values in the array?
